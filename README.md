## Data-Driven Stock Price Prediction and Portfolio Optimization

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is by using machine learning models to predict stock prices and optimizing investment portfolios. This project consist of two parts:

1. The first part is stock price prediction, it will help the traders and stock investors in decisions making while making investments in stock. We will use the historical data to predict future stock price, mainly focusing on NASDAQ Stocks. I am aiming to use machine learning model, I have explored Mean Variance Model and Random Forest Models, but for the moment I am in the process of which model will I be use for stock price prediction.


2. The second key goal of the project is portfolio optimization which wil help to mitigate risk and increase the returns.
